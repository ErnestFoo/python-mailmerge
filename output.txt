MD: - The contract commencement and termination dates are the same, effectively making it a zero-duration contract. This is out of the industry norm because typically contracts have a specified duration.
- The Time is of the Essence clause may imply a stricter timing requirement than typical for cleaning services. This is out of the industry norm because cleaning services usually have more flexible timing requirements.
- The Alcohol and Drugs clause is unusually strict as it terminates the agreement immediately upon the presence or possession of alcohol or drugs without requiring the individual to be under the influence or that it impacts their work. This is out of the industry norm because typically such clauses require impairment or impact on work performance.
- The date format ('5th of September, 2024') used in the signature blocks is unconventional. This is out of the industry norm because the typical numerical date format (e.g., 09/05/2024) is more commonly used.
